# Controlled vs. uncontrolled components

## Controlled components

Components that do not keep track of their own state - all state is passed in as props (e.g. when we use the useState hook with text inputs).

## Uncontrolled components

Components that keep track of their own states and release data only when some event occurs (e.g. the submit event for HTML forms).
